# Wolfgang
Free, open source, modular, and customizable Digital Audio Workstation.

Preamble:
Wolfgang is a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) intended to fulfill the role of an open source and free alternatives
to professional studio software. Linux was a big inspiration, with its countless free and open source alternatives
to many common programs, and I hope this project will make its way to Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Description:
Wolfgang is a modular component based DAW, intended to be infintely customizable and expandable. As with most DAWs,
plug-ins can be created and added into the program for use, and many of the libraries, samples, and features 
available in programs such as FL Studio will be available in this program.

The general program will be a skeleton, consisting of the workspace application and some defualt components, but 
users are encouraged to develop and share new components for their workspace, and to customize it exactly as they
see fit.

This program will assume you know exactly what youre doing (much like the language it's written in) and will allow
the user to do anything they can think of, provided they are able to obtain or make the tools required.
